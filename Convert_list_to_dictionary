# #In Python, the main difference between a tuple and a dictionary is that a tuple is a fixed-size collection, while a dictionary is a collection of arbitrary size: 
# Tuple
# A tuple is a collection of elements separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses. Tuples are ordered and unchangeable, and they allow duplicate members.
# Dictionary
# A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and associated with a value. Dictionaries are unordered and changeable, and they do not allow duplicate members.
